                <p>
                    The traditional office has changed. In a world of hybrid work, connection is
                    key.

                <p>
                    The work week is no longer about commuting to a lifeless cubicle, trapped by
                    the 9 - 5. It’s about flexibility. Lister Place celebrates the idea of
                    meeting up when it matters. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whether you meet your team one day, two days, or more per week – be sure to
                    make it count. Use your in-person time to make meaningful impact, together.

                <p data-text="subtext">Home of Joseph Lister</p>
                <p>
                    The name Lister Place originates from Joseph Lister; previous occupier of
                    the building and one of the great pioneers of antiseptic medicine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before the 1800s, post-surgery mortality rates averaged around 50%. Lister’s
                    Antisepsis System discovery changed this forever – by forming the basis of
                    modern infection control as we know it today.1
                </p>
                <p>
                    The legacy of Lister’s extraordinary work carries through the building, to
                    the next generation of revolutionary thinkers.

                        Lister Place is ideal for what we need as a team. We have privacy to be
                        as loud as we need to be, but at the same time as being able to connect
                        to other companies while grabbing a freshly ground coffee in the main
                        lobby.

                        The building is beautiful and the rooms are really well appointed. The
                        range of different seating spaces help us work effectively and
                        productively, and the whole Paper Tiger team are able to really
                        concentrate on the given agenda.
